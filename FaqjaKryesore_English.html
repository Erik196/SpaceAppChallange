			<h1> What Is Our Carbon Footprint? </h1>

			<h2>  WHAT IS OUR CARBOON FOOTPRINT? </h2>
			<p style = "text-align: justify;">
				Your carbon footprint is the sum of all emissions of CO2
				(carbon dioxide), which were induced by your activities in
				a given time frame. Usually a carbon footprint is calculated
				for the time period of a year. The total amount of greenhouse
				gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities,
				usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide (CO2).
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>  Each of the following activities adds 1 kg of CO2 to your personal carbon footprint: </h2>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li> Production of 1/3 of an American cheeseburger </li>
					<li> Production of 2 plastic bottles </li>
					<li> Production of 5 plastic bags </li>
					<li> Operate your computer for 32 hours (60 Watt consumption assumed) </li>
					<li> Fly with a plane a distance of 2.2 km or 1.375 miles. </li>
					<li> Drive with your car a distance of 6 km or 3.75 miles (assuming 7.3 liters petrol per 100 km or 39 mpg) </li>
					<li> Travel by public transportation (train or bus) a distance of 10 to 12 km (6.5 to 7 miles) </li>
				</ol>

			<h2>  WHAT IS GHG?  </h2>
			<p style = "text-align: justify;">
				Greenhouse gases are those that can absorb and emit infrared
				radiation. The carbon footprint is a very powerful tool to
				understand the impact of personal behavior on global warming.
				Carbon dioxide is a so called greenhouse gas causing global warming.
				Other greenhouse gases which might be emitted as a result of
				your activities are e.g. methane and ozone. These greenhouse
				gases are normally also taken into account for the carbon 
				footprint. They are converted into the amount of CO2 that
				would cause the same effects on global warming
				(this is called equivalent CO2 amount).

			<h2>  The LandsatLook Viewer is a prototype tool that was developed to allow rapid online viewing and access to the USGS Landsat image archives. This viewer allows you to:  </h2>
			<p style = "text-align: justify;">
				<ul>
					<li> Interactively explore the Landsat archive at up to full resolution directly from a common Web browser </li>
					<li> Search for specific Landsat images based on area of interest, acquisition date, or cloud cover </li>
					<li> Compare image features and view changes through time </li>
					<li> Display configurable map information layers in combination with the Landsat imagery </li>
					<li> Create a customized image display and export as a simple graphic file </li>
					<li> View metadata and download the full-band source imagery </li>
					<li> Search by address or place, or zoom to a point, bounding box, or Sentinel-2 Tile or Landsat WRS-1 or WRS-2 Path/Row   </li>
					<li> Generate and download a video animation of the oldest to newest images displayed in the viewer </li>

			<p> The two most common factors are: </p>
			
			<h2> DEPELTION OF RESOURCES </h2>
			<p style = "text-align: justify;">				
				Large carbon footprints deplete resources on large and small
				scales, from a country's deforestation activities to one home's
				increased use of air conditioning. The more those with large
				carbon footprints use resources, the more greenhouse gases
				increase and spur further climate change. 
			</p>
			
			<h2> CLIMATE CHANGE  </h2>
			<p style = "text-align: justify;">
				Climate change is the ultimate effect of large carbon footprints.
				Greenhouse gases, whether natural or human-produced, contribute
				to the warming of the planet. From 1990 to 2005, carbon dioxide
				emissions increased by 31%. By 2008, the emissions had contributed 
				to a 35% increase in radiative warming, or a shift in Earth's
				energy balance toward warming, over 1990 levels.

			<h2> HOW GREEN IS YOUR SCHOOL? </h2>
			<p>				
				<ul>
					<li> Does your college have a recycling programm for its waste paper, cardboard, cans and bottles? </li>
					<li> Does the college have a policy to use recycled paper? </li>
					<li> Does your college seek to avoid the use of disposable paper, plastic, foam cups and plates? </li>

			<h2>  SOLUTION </h2>
			<p style = "text-align: justify;">
				As an individual, the change can start with using an
				environmentally-friendly transport. Using public transport
				these days is not hard or costly at all. Statistics say that
				in western Europe, it is 10 times better to use public 
				transport than traveling by car. Also it is important to 
				avoid flights as much as possible. The greenhouse gas
				balance of flights has the highest level of emissions when
				compared to other forms of transport.
			</p>
			
			<p style = "text-align: justify;">
				Secondly, it is crucial to save energy. Energy takes a lot
				of pollution to be created, and sometimes it is produced by
				recourses that are not recyclable. For instance, replacing
				normal light bulbs with LEDs, turning the light off when
				leaving the room, taking short showers , switching off devices
				that are in standby mode, closing the windows when heating
				the room or drying the clothes with the energy created by the
				sun, a renewable type of energy. All these small things done
				by each of us can reduce the emissions in a considerable scale.
			</p>
			
			<p style = "text-align: justify;">
				If we start this from ourselves, then it can become a global
				situation and that is precisely what it should be. As a community,
				there are many actions we could take too. The first is surely
				to raise awareness. There could be campaigns that include real
				scientists explaining the real cause and the real consequences
				that could come with climate change. If everyone would understand
				properly in what situation we are, it would be a lot easier to
				take action. After understanding the concept, we could start by 
				the most important thing: using renewable energy in every house.
				Renewable energy is a very clean and cheap type of energy.
				For example, not warming water with electricity but with solar
				panels. Many things follow after this, like having car-free days,
				consuming less food, recycling plastic and dangerous materials
				for the earth, planting trees etc. 
			</p>
			
			<p style = "text-align: justify;">
				To conclude, this is a case that includes us all. As a community
				of states it is crucial to immediately leave the politics behind
				and think of our future, of our successors’ future, for our home’s 
				future. We were provided all of this, we were provided with life,
				and it is our job to take care of it. Change has to come from each,
				and it should end with us as one.
